# Things have not done
- Automated test.
- User guide.
- Use a validation schema library like zod, yup, or valibot.
- Use debounce (from lodash) so that React does not rerender on every keystroke
- If a state manager was used, SwapHistory could have been refactored to used in App.tsx instead of being inside SwapCard.
