# Things have not done
- Automated test.
- User guide.
- Use a validation schema library like zod, yup, or valibot.
- Use debounce (from lodash) so that React does not rerender on every keystroke
- If a state manager was used, SwapHistory could have been refactored to used in App.tsx instead of being inside SwapCard.
- Omitted icons since I have not found easy and programmatical solution to turn the current number of svg into icons and sizing the icon as a React Component
    - This is the SO that I am consulting https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56826626/create-dynamic-svg-icons-component-in-reactjs
